Manuscript Title: Identifying the leverage points using a blend of machine 
learning and statistical approaches


Authors: Sareena Rose, Dr. S.Nickolas, Dr. S. M. Sunoj & Dr. S. Sangeetha


Name of the program: Clustering using quantile regression and POOLED DISTANCES ALGORITHM (PDA)

PDA uses DetectMultVarOutliers (https://www.github.com/AntonSemechko/Multivariate-Outliers) with some modifications

The code is developed in Matlab 2018b and uses Statistical & Machine Learning ToolBox

The above two programs is used to train the dataset and creates a framework for Regular Observations, Vertical Outliers, Good and Bad Leverage points.

Then the test data set is classified using the above framework

The code file for testing is test_framework
