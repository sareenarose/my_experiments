Manuscript Title: Identifying the leverage points using a blend of machine 
learning and statistical approaches


Authors: Sareena Rose, Dr. S.Nickolas, Dr. S. M. Sunoj & Dr. S. Sangeetha


Name of the program: Clustering using quantile regression and POOLED DISTANCES ALGORITHM (PDA)

PDA uses DetectMultVarOutliers (https://www.github.com/AntonSemechko/Multivariate-Outliers) omitting the generation of graphs

The code is developed in Matlab 2018b and uses Statistical & Machine Learning ToolBox also the open source code in Python is also added

The above two programs is used to train the dataset and creates a framework for Regular Observations, Vertical Outliers, Good and Bad Leverage points.

Then the test data set is classified using the above framework using any simple distance metric

Use the files in this order 1) Clustering using quantile regression and 2) POOLED DISTANCES ALGORITHM (PDA)

The first phase returns some clusters and for each cluster PDA should be run separately
